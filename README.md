# J-ST-Link-PCB

PCB for connecting a programmer (J-Link or ST-Link) to an microcontroller via Jumper cables or 10 pin header.
It's also possible to monitor the target supply by LED or supply the target (with voltage regulator) or both, when a 3 way jumper is used.
Because of this, Vtarget is called VCC.

## Components
Not all components are needed.
Some footprints can be used in multiple ways.
Some options cancel out each other.

Plan and solder what you need for your case.

## Schematic

### Connectors
- 20 pin header
  - For standard ST-Link or J-Link
  - Can be soldered as male connector on top side for connecting to a cable
  - Can be soldered as female connector on bottom side for connecting directly to the programmer
    - PCB dimensions are designed for this usage with ST-Link/V2 and J-Link Base
    - I've found them as [2.54 mm pitch 20 pin female header with polarizing key, wide type on AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32956131069.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.14.36e81802jonIUv)
  - Pinout is mostly [JTAG Interface Connection](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/technology/interface-description/) with changes for ST-Link:
    - Pin 1+2: Bridged together (Some ST-Link need both wired together for cable detection or something while pin 2 is unused on J-Link, so connecting them seems fine
    - Pin 4: UART RX (ST-Link)
    - Pin 6: UART TX (ST-Link)
    - Pin 8: Boot0 (ST-Link)
    - Pin 10: SWIM (ST-Link)
    - Pin 14: SWIM_nRST (ST-Link)
- 6 pin header
  - Designed to be compatible with [CN4 of the break away ST-Link on STM32 nucleo boards](https://ehelectronics.wordpress.com/2015/12/05/stm32-nucleo-and-st-link/)
  - Can be soldered straight down to sit nicely above the Nucleo ST-Link
  - Can be soldered to the side to be combined with the 20 pin female header and will still fit nicely on the J-Link base
  - Pin 1-4 can be used with pogo pins [for programming hoverboards (SWD Programming Header)](https://github.com/lucysrausch/hoverboard-firmware-hack)
- Two 10 pin headers
  - 1.27 mm pitch version for connecting directly to my targets
    - I've found them as [1.27mm pitch SMD male shrouded box header on AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32951697063.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.40.36e81802jonIUv) and [on Mouser](https://my.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Amphenol-FCI/20021521-00010C1LF?qs=pLQRQR43dtoQtFgybK4DSw%3D%3D)
  - 2.54 mm pitch version for other targets, Tag connect or other adapters
  - Both connectors share the same pinout
    - It's designed to be compatible with [the PCB-side connector of the 10-Pin Needle Adapter](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/accessories/adapters/10-pin-needle-adapter/) and ARM 10 pin JTAG/SWD
    - Pin 5, 7 and 9 are [configurable via solder jumpers](https://github.com/Pixtxa/J-ST-Link-PCB/new/main?readme=1#jumpers)
- Three pin headers on top
  - Can be used for connecting jumper cables
  - Can be used to solder wires directly on
  - STM8 SWIM
    - For SWIM programming with ST-LINK/V1, maybe also /V2
    - Used by STM8 microcontrollers
    - Implemented but untested
  - STM32 SWD
    - For SWD programming with J-Link and ST-Link
    - Used by STM32 Microcontrollers
  - UART
    - ST-Link features UART somehow, so this might be interesting for debugging or programming ESP8266 or ESP32
    - Implemented but untested

### Jumpers
- J1
  - NC*: Don't monitor/supply VCC - VCC is only connected to the programmer
  - LEFT+MIDDLE: Monitor VCC - VCC is connected to the programmer and an LED
  - MIDDLE+RIGHT: Supply VCC - VCC is connected to the programmer and the supply voltage
  - LEFT+MIDDLE+RIGHT: Monitor and supply VCC - VCC is connected to the programmer, an LED and the supply voltage
- J3
  - NC*: Use voltage regulator for supply voltage
  - SET: Skip voltage regulator, wire Pin 19 (5 V on J-Link; 3.3 V on ST-Link) directly to J1
- J5
  - CON*: Connect Supply to pin 5
  - NC: Not connect anything to pin 5
  - GNC: Connect Ground to pin 5
- J7
  - CON*: Connect RTCK to pin 7
  - NC: Not connect anything to pin 7
  - GNC: Connect Ground to pin 7
- J9
  - CON*: Connect nTrst to pin 9
  - NC: Not connect anything to pin 9
  - GNC: Connect Ground to pin 9
* = default

### LED + Resistor
* Only lights up if J1 is selected to monitor VCC and there is voltage on VCC
* Both 0603
* LED color doesn't really matter, chose what you like, but make sure it works with your target voltage (usualy red works with lowest voltage)
* Resistor value depends on LED and target voltage, but 330...1000 Î© should be fine for most LEDs

### Voltage regulator + capacitors
* Designed for 3.3 V via TLV70433 with 100n 0603 capacitors
* Other voltage regulators might be compatible with this footprint
* If unused, J3 can be set
